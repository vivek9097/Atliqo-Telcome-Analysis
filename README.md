# Atliqo Telecom 5G Impact Analysis
This project analyzes the performance of Atliqo Telecom before and after the implementation of 5G technology. Using SQL, Excel, and BI tools, we explored metrics such as revenue, ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), market share, and customer behavior across major Indian cities.

## Project Overview
After launching 5G services, Atliqo experienced mixed results. While ARPU increased by 11.05%, both total revenue and active users decreased. This raised concerns about plan pricing and user retention.

### Key areas analyzed
Revenue and ARPU by city before vs. after 5G
Active users and unsubscriptions
Market share across major telecom competitors
Plan-wise performance and revenue contribution

##  Tools & Technologies
SQL – For querying and aggregating telecom usage data
Microsoft Excel – For data cleaning and quick analytics
Power BI – For creating insightful dashboards and visualizations

## Key Insights
Total Revenue: ₹3,187.36 Cr after 5G
ARPU: ₹200.74 (↑ 11.05%)
Market Share (Atliqo): Dropped from 19% to 18%
Most Successful Plans: P1 (Top performer) and P11 (launched post-5G, high growth)
Cities with positive revenue growth: Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, Lucknow

## Challenges Identified
Decline in active users by 69.83 lakh
High unsubscription rates, especially in high-population cities
Increase in ARPU indicates plan price hikes, which may have discouraged users
Atliqo is the only telecom operator among competitors to lose market share post-5G

## Recommendations
Review and adjust plan pricing to retain and attract users
Design more plans similar to P1 and P11 that provide value at competitive prices
Focus on cities with positive revenue growth for targeted marketing
Improve customer retention strategies to reduce churn post-5G
